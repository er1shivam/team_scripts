Hey Lyle, I'm happy to hear that you have definite goals in place. The 20k/mo barrier is a very real thing, and I remember when I was in a similar position of feeling like it was just out of reach.

50,"Quick overview on Lyle: 

Lyle owns a business where he focuses on finding clients that have an existing business, but their websites are not performing as well as they should be! Biggest struggle right now is finding consistent clients for his SEO agency! Lyle would like to reach $20k/month and scale from there! He is about two clients away from that number now! Now that his processes are in place, he wants to focus more on the finding clients side of things and scaling!

Was doing DFY digital marketing for brick & mortar small biz back in 2017.

Now, essentially merging those 2 to help other Conscious coaches / entrepreneurs / healers 

This is the first time I‚Äôve specifically offered to help others launch or fix their coaching / consulting programs as a service.
